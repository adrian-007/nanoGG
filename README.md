A Gadu-Gadu client written in Qt 4 targetting Symbian 9.2 Series 60, Symbian Anna and Symbian Belle. Most of testing was done using Nokia E90 and Windows - since it's a Qt application, it runs on any platform Qt supports. Later it became a one of the tools for reverse-engineering new version of Gadu-Gadu protocol, which turned out to be based on Google's Protobufs, which wasn't known at the time.

Development was done around 2010 and was discontinued due to death of both, Symbian and my phone. Code here is for historical purpose.
